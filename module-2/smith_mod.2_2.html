		<h1>Assignment 2.3-Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
		<h2>Chapter 1-Unsure, A Tale of Joseph</h2>
		<p class="intro">I was born and raised in Landover, Maryland, Prince Georges County. I am a child of silence, since I was in the womb. At least that is the information given to me by my mother. I realized that silence has made me unsure about my direction in life.</p>
		<p>As I grew older I have aquired the skill to use my silence to observe my surroundings. My silence have kept me content, safe and comfortable in everything. At what cost will I allow my silence to keep me from acheiving my goals.  </p>
		<p><span class="sentence">I have always had the desire and passion to create worlds and tell stories.</span> I want my stories to be told via Video Games. I want to allow others to experience worlds beyond our own and follow a story through the eyes of another being.</p>
		<p>In order to do so I need to figure out what I truly desire. I need to understand the path I am to take. I need to be loud and end my silence. </p>
